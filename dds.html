<p>E-Commerce and Social Media</p>

<p> Hope is a Swedish fashion label created in 2001, by the designers Ann Ringstrand and Stefan Söderberg. The first brand shop opened in Stockholm, Sweden, in 2006, followed by 9 more Hope Shops. The Hope Collection is also sold by over 260 exclusive retailers on 23 markets and in 7 Hope Shop in Shops.</p>
 
<p>Together with four other Hyper Island students, did we work with Hope STHLM’s E-Commerce and marketing channels. I developed a social media strategy based on their analytics and a lot of market research, in order to drive more traffic to their online shop. If you see the picture to the left: <a href="http://instagram.com/fridavega"> Frida Vega Salomonsson</a> was a big part of that strategy – a way of attract a younger and more edgie costumers</p>

<p>That being said, did Hope STHLM adopted the marketing strategy that I built for them including a digital handbook, CRM strategy and overall guideline for online performance.</p>

<p>Hyper Island and Volvo: The Creative Hack</p>

<p>Brief: We had 72 hours to solve Volvo Innovation Challenge. The main goal for us was to create a new business strategy with focus on future technology.</p>

<p>My Role: Research and pitch idea to Volvo's panel</p>

<p>Result: Together with four other Hyper Island students, I developed a business concept based on an universal and connected operative systems for automotive driving cars.
In the same way as Volvo was the first company to introduce the 3 Point Belt System, we would like to see them in the lead of connecting all cars on the road.</p>
