<p>Hyper Island and Volvo: The Creative Hack</p>

<p>Brief: We had 72 hours to solve Volvo Innovation Challenge. The main goal for us was to create a new business strategy with focus on future technology.</p>

<p>My Role: Research and pitch idea to Volvo's panel</p>

<p>Result: Together with four other Hyper Island students, I developed a business concept based on an universal and connected operative systems for automotive driving cars.
In the same way as Volvo was the first company to introduce the 3 Point Belt System, we would like to see them in the lead of connecting all cars on the road.</p>

<p>Hyper Island and Unicef: Operation Dagsverke</p>

<p> Brief: Operation Dagsverke (Day’s Work) is a fundraising and information campaign in which students raise money for schools and education projects in other countries. The campaign has been around for over fifty years and it is completely voluntary for the schools if they want to participate in the campaign.</p>

<p>Unicef's goal was to increase with 50 % with at least 150 signed up schools within 2016 and another increase the year after with 200 sign up schools. They wanted schools to perceive the O.D as something positive, as a support for the school's mission to discuss human rights and an inspiring day for teachers and students.</p>

<p>My Role: Research and developed the research</p>

<p>Result: Together with four other Hyper Island students we developed a social media strategy, with the hashtag #backabarnen</p>

<p>Hyper Island and Transdev: 24H Society Hack</p>

<p>We wanted Transdev to be transparent of their cooperation. We believed that they could benefit by connect their transparency and listen to people voices.</p>

<p>A Society Hack is not something you create during 72 hours of brainstorming, that is something that constantly should be progressing.</p>
