								<h2>Data Driven Marketing<br/>
								<a href="http://zoegas.se">Zoegas</a> & <a href="http://www.ddb.se">DDB</a></h2>
								<p>
								Together with four other Digital Data Strategist Students from Hyper Island, I created a digital strategy for an always on campaign on Social Media for Zoegas based on research, hypothesis, surverys, testing and tons of data that we gained insights from.

								<p>We also presented an idea for their own channel to gain more insights about their customers that would build a stronger connection and value between the customer and Zoégas.

								<h2>Prototyping<br />
								HTML, CSS and JavaScript</h2>
								<p><a href="http://projectworthly.github.io/#firstPage">Worthly</a> is a website made by me and four other Digital Data Strategist students from Hyper Island, during a project where we explored HTML, CSS and JavaScript with Api's to visualize data.
								<p>We wanted to shed some light over the current housing situation in Stockholm. Our thesis was as following: Where can you afford to buy an appartment in Stockholm, with your downpayment? We coded along in GitHub, my priority was to develop the front-end of this Website</p></p>

								<p>Another example of prototype projects is this website you're looking at right now, as I developed from scratch myself</p>

								<h2> E-COMMERCE AND SOCIAL MEDIA MONOTORING AND <br /><a href="http://hope-sthlm.com">Hope STHLM</a></h2>
								<p> During a monitoring and reporting module at Hyper Island, I worked with Hope STHLM along with four other digital data strategist students. We delivered a very specific handbook, a digital strategy and also a concept which included collaboration with influencers. The work we pitched for them went to market.

								<p>
								We used Google Analytics, Hotjar, Optimizely and other tools in order to measure their online perfomance. We also researched a lot in order to create a concept for them to use on their social media channels.
							

								</p>
								<p>
									A lot of the focus was to get better user experience on their website, increase conversion on all their markets and social media channels and help them to optimized their marketing budget.
								</p>
								<p>

								I've used Google Analytics as a main tool but also Hotjar and Optimizely.

								<h2> Business Development <br /><a href="http://www.volvo.com">Volvo</a></h2>
						Brief
We had 72 hours to solve Volvo Innovation Challenge. The main goal for us was to create a new business strategy with focus on future technology.

<p>

My Role
Develop a business strategy, pitch our concept to the Volvo panel and Hyper Island students.
</p>
<p>

Result
Together with four other Hyper Island students, I developed a business concept based on an universal and connected operative systems for automotive driving cars.
In the same way as Volvo was the first company to introduce the 3 Point Belt System, we would like to see them in the lead of connecting all cars on the road.
