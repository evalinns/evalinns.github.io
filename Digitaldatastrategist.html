        Hope STHLM is a clothes brand based in Stockholm, that not only having physicals shops around Sweden but also focusing digitally for their e-commerce. They wanted us to increase the male traffic to their E-commerce site and understand the customer better.
         </p>

          <p> 
        Solution
        My team built an overall digital strategy, where I focused on their social media and how they can use data driven marketing to drive more traffic. We based the strategy on their customers behaviour from Google Analytics and tracked everything to come up with their own strategy.

        My Rolle
        Digital Strategy, Data Analysis and Social Media
        In the beginning of the project I wanted to understand the market. Therefore I researched a lot about how the market is today, to have a better understanding of the digital data e-commerce market. We as a group took time to understand the core value of Hope STHLM and after weeks with Google Analytics (and other tools that we used) we come up with insights that they could improve, within their channels based valuable data.

<p> Tools that I used: Google Analytics, Pingdom.com, Facebook </p>
